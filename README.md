# ElasticSearch

This repository is designed to help users understand and implement ElasticSearch, a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real-time.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- ElasticSearch installed on your machine

## Installation

Download and install ElasticSearch from the official [Elastic.co website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch):

1. Extract the ElasticSearch archive.
2. Navigate to the ElasticSearch directory and start ElasticSearch:

   ```bash
   cd elasticsearch-<version>
   ./bin/elasticsearch  # On Unix systems
   .\bin\elasticsearch.bat  # On Windows
   ```

## Basic Usage

ElasticSearch runs as a service accessible primarily via HTTP. The following example shows how to index a document and then retrieve it via a search query.

### `basic_usage.py`

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Connect to the local ElasticSearch instance
es = Elasticsearch()

# Index a document
doc = {
    'author': 'John Doe',
    'text': 'ElasticSearch: cool. bonsai cool.',
    'timestamp': '2021-04-23T10:30:00'
}
response = es.index(index="test-index", id=1, document=doc)
print(response['result'])

# Retrieve the document
retrieved_doc = es.get(index="test-index", id=1)
print(retrieved_doc['_source'])

# Search for documents
query = {
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "author": "John"
    }
  }
}
search_result = es.search(index="test-index", query=query)
print(search_result['hits']['hits'])
```
